        <p id="f2">We use selection factor points to help assess your eligibility for the Federal Skilled Worker Program.<br>

            <strong>These points are different from the points we use to</strong> <a href="http://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp"> rank your profile in the Express Entry pool</a>.<br>
            
            We’ll assess your selection factors and assign an overall score out of 100.<br>
            
            <strong>If you score 67 points or higher,</strong> you may qualify for the Federal Skilled Worker Program. You can then submit a profile to the Express Entry pool.<br>
            <strong>If you score lower then 67 points,</strong> you won't qualify for the program. You may be able to get a higher score by doing things like:
            <ul>
                <li>improving your language skills</li>
                <li>completing another degree, diploma, or certificate</li>
